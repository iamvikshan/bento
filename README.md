  later, here are some of my recommendations, please note that these are
  affiliate links, I will get a small commission if you buy a VPS using these
  links.

- Node.js v20.0.0 or later
- npm v7.0.0 or later
- A [Bento](https://bento.me/vikshan) account
- A custom domain, I recommend [NameCheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/vikshan) for
  this. Please note this is an affiliate link, I will get a small commission if
  you buy a domain using this link. Some of the VPS providers I mentioned above
  also sell domains. You can also use [Freenom](https://freenom.com) for a free
  domain.
- PM2 (optional)
- Apache2 (Required for VPS ) - I won't go deep on this, you can check a
  documentation I wrote for my Discord bot's dashboard
  [here](https://docs.vikshan.me/installation/dashboard/custom-domain), it is
  basically the same thing.
- Certbot (Required for SSL on VPS) see
  [here](https://docs.vikshan.me/installation/dashboard/custom-domain/ssl-certificate)

## Installation

### Instalation in a VPS or PC

1. Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the root directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vixshan/bento.git
cd bento
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables,
   see `.env.example` for an example

```bash
BENTO_USERNAME=<your bento username>
```

3. Run `npm start` in the root directory

```bash
npm start
```

The app starts using PM2, you can now access your app at `http://localhost` or
`http://localhost:3000` if you're not using a reverse proxy.

To test your app, run `npm test` in the root directory

```bash
npm test
```

- Set up a reverse proxy to the app using Apache2 or Nginx. See
  [here](https://docs.vikshan.me/installation/dashboard/custom-domain) for
  Apache2 and
  [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) for
  Nginx.
